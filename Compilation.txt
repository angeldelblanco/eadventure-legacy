Compilation instructions:
=========================

e-Adventure is an open source product.

Follow this steps to download and execute the source code in your computer.

Requirements:
Java 1.6+
Eclipse 3.2+


Step 1 - Checkout
-----------------
Use your favorite SVN manager to download the latest version from sourceforge.

The contents of the project are actually a complete Eclipse Java 
Project. There will be compilation errors. Do not despair :)



Step 2 - Add the supplementary JAR files
----------------------------------------
To preserve bandwith the static jar files used by e-adventure are not part of 
the SVN project and must be downloaded separately.

To add these libraris, download the file compilationJars.zip from sourceforge.
Extract its contents into a 'jars' folder at the project's root folder.

This should solve most but not all of the compilation errors.



Step 3 - Link the plugin.jar library
------------------------------------
There is one final jar file that must be linked separately. This is a file that
is part of the JDK, and we cannot offer jar files from the Java SDK for direct
download.

In order to link this file to the project, follow the next steps:
1.- Go to Project Properties --> Java Build Path
2.- Select the option "Add External JARs..."
3.- Look for plugin.jar in the JDK folder in your hard drive (it should be 
    inside the /jre/lib folder)
    
This library is only used when the games are executed as applets, and in those
cases the browser plugin will be providing the binaries (i.e. don't worry about
this when distributing the platform).

    
    
Step 4 - Launch the tools
-------------------------
The main files are in es.eucm.eadventure.editor and es.eucm.eadventure.engine

Enjoy!
