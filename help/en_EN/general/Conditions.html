<h1>Conditions</h1>

<h2>Icons on the table</h2>

When the icon is on grey, the conditions cannot be edited (you have to select the corresponding line of the table).<br>
When the icon has a color, a click over it allows the edition of the condition throught the <a href="../flagsVars/conditions.html">conditions</a> dialog.<br>
The open lock <img src="Conditions_files/open.png"> points out that there are no conditions. The closed lock  <img src="Conditions_files/closed.png"> indicates the opposite.<br>

<h2>Empty conditions</h2>

When there are no conditions (<img src="Conditions_files/open.png">) those are always either active or valid.<br>
