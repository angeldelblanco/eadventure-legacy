<h1>Adaptation Profile</h1>



<p>The way of generating the adaptation profiles is very sililar to the generation of  
<A href="../assessment/assessmentProfile.html" label="assessment profiles" title="assessment profiles">assessment profiles</A> . 
These are used to adapt the behavior of the game based on a set of "external properties"
coming from the server of learning (state of the LMS). When these properties are fulfilled to the beginning of 
the chapter a set of flags and initial variables are activated or deactivated automatically and there changes
 the first scene (if desired, of course). With this it is possible to change the number of available objects, adapt the difficulty 
 according to the student profile, etc. Also these external properties can be  empty in order to make changes in 
game automatically at startup. This way it is possible to provide differents version of the game simply by changing the 
 the adaptation profile associated with game.</p>

<p>In the same way that in assessment profiles, the type of adapatation profile must be set as SCORM 2004 or SCORM v1.2
if we are going to make an exportation of this type.If you select any type, a list will appear in the attribute "Id" of the 
state of the unit of learning with the parts of the SCORM data model which are available.
