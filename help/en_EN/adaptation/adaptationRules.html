<h1>Adaptation: Initial State</h1>
<p>The adaptation rules have a set of properties that must be fulfilled in the LMS
in order for the actions associated with the rule to be executed. The above mentioned
actions follow the same idea that the <a href="../adaptation/adaptationInitialState.html" label="initial state" title="initial state">
initial state</a>, meaning that when the properties in LMS (defined in "LMS State" tab)
are fulfilled the rules will be executed. The rules have an associated initial state
(in this case it is showed at right of the rule description in the table of rules).
When the rule is run, it will updated the variables and the flags that appear in the tab "Game State"
in the low part of the screen (once we have selected one particular rule).</p>
<p>
It is necessary to emphasize that only the last fulfilled rule will be executed, 
considering the last one the one that is in the low part of rules list.</p>
