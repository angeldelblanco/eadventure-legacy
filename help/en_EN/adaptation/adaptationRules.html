<h1>Adaptation Initial State</h1>
<p>The adaptation rules has a set of properties that must be fulfilled in the LMS in order that actions associated with the rule will be executed. The above mentioned actions follows the same idea that the <a href="../adaptation/adaptationInitialState.html" label="initial state" title="initial state"> initial state</a>, it means, when the properties in LMS (defined in "LMS State" tab) were fulfilled there will be executed the initial scene that has associate the rule (in this case it is showed at right of the rule description in the table of rules), and will be updated the variables and the flags that appear in the tab "Game State" in the low part of the screen (once we have selected one determined rule).</p>
<p>
It is necessary to emphasize  only the last fulfilled rule will be executed, 
considering the last one the one that is in the low part of rules list.</p>
