    <h1>Student Feedback Configuration</h1>
    <p>For the assessment profiles it is possible to select if we want that the report appears to the user as "feedback" at the end of the game. If we select this option, we will be able to configure if we want to send the report automatically by e-mail. Notice that for data privacy it is not possible to send the report for e-mail without showing it first to the pupil and that this one gives his consent.</p>

    <p>In order to sending of mails works it is necessary to fill the information of our SMTP e-mail server, whether an account of Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc. We must press the "Edit SMTP configuration". The first two fields, SMTP Server and SMTP Port must be provided by each internet provider. The second ones correspond with the user's name and password that we use to accede to our e-mail account.</p>
