<h1>Assessment Profile</h1>



<p>In &lt e-adventure &gt games it is possible to do an automatic assessment of the student interaction. 
The assessment profiles specifies how will be the assessment reports. The profiles has a set of rules 
that evaluates certain game states (flags and vars values) and it has an specific associated actions that will be triggered
when tha game reach that state. Only it is possible to assign a profile for chapter, but we can support several profiles to
 have different possibilities of evaluation, choosing in every case which to use.  Hereby the games are reusable in different 
 contexts and for different public.</p>

<p> Let's analyze the possibilities of the profile of evaluation:</p>
