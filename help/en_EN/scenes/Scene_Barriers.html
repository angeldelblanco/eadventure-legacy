<h1>Scene: barriers</h1>
<p>The  barriers are rectangles which are defined on a scene with a very specific function: they prevent the protagonist (the other characters are not affected by barriers) go through a given area. The barriers have some conditions, so  when a barrier with active conditions is brought into the path of the player when moving (even slightly), the protagonist will stand right in front of the barrier, without traspassing it. If conditions stop satisfying then stop the barrier disappears.</p>
