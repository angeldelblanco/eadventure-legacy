<h1>Scene</h1>
<h2>Concept</h2>
<p>The scenes are the basic unit to manage a chapter. <span class="referencia_literal">tal</span></p>
<p>Each scene can have a background image, reference to characters, objects, atrezzo objects and some other particular features (barriers, exits, etc.)</p>
<h2>Scenes panel</h2>
<p>In the scenes panel we have a list with all the scenes of the chapter, as well as a diagram where we can see the different scenes with their backgrounds, and the relationship between them.</p>
<p>The element of the panel can be sort by clicking and droping with the mouse, and the zoom can be used in order to watch at any particular position of the panel with more detail.</p>
