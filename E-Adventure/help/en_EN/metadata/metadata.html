  &nbsp;&nbsp; The metadata are basically data which describes another data. It is used to ubicate some other data. <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata" label="metadatos" title="metadatos">Metadata description on the Wikipedia.</A> <br>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A very interesting feature that provides the platform is the ability to export projects as self-contained packages that can be deployed on e-Learning servers that meet the specifications LOM and IMS-CP. Without the intention of overwhelm with technical details we just will say that the games exported in this way can be used in modern online servers as if they were HTML documents , and run them through a Web browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before exporting a game as AO we can add some data that the server will use in order to storage in a repository. These data can be edited by accessing the File menu and clicking on the &quot;Properties of learning object&quot;,and then choosing the type of metadata edition.</p>
