<h1>Scene: active zones</h1>

<p>The active areas are rectangles or polygons we can define on the scenes which a section of the background is marked in order to interactuate with it. They are useful tools when we have riched backgrounds with objects or characters already drawed, or in photo-realism tasks</p>
<p>Basically, an active area behaves like an object belonging to one single scene.</p>
