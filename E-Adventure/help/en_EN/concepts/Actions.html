<h1>Actions</h1>

Actions define what can be performed over an object, character or active area.<br>

<h2>Type of actions</h2>

"Examine"
"Take" (only objects and active areas)
"Use"
"Customizable"
"Use with" (only objects)
"Give to" (only objects)
"Talk to..." (only characters)

<h2>Conditions</h2>

The conditions of the actions indicate when it can be performed.<br>
If the conditions of the actions are not active, the action button will not be drawn (unless it is an action with a default behaviour, see below). This does not meet if the action has alternative effects. In this case the button will always be drawn.<br>

<h2>Alternative effects</h2>

<h2>Default actions</h2>

<p>In all the elements appears by default the &quot;Examine&quot; action, which leads the player to say the &quot;Detailed description&quot; of the element.<br>
  In the objects appear by default the &quot;take/use&quot; action, even if no action is performed, unless the player indicates that the object cannot be taken, In the characters appears by default the &quot;Talk to...&quot; action, but the player will say that is not posible to maintain a conversation with the character&quot;<br>
  The behaviour of the default actions can be changed by adding an action of the corresponding type.</p>
