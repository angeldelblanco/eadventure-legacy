<p><b><center>First person adventure</center></b><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You have selected to create a new adventure in 1st person mode (player is not shown).<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no avatar for the player. The player explores the game himself, and transitions between
 scenes are instantaneous. Usually these games are designed using photos to configure the scenes. Hence the player
 interacts in first person with a very real-looking world, in which you can turn or go back in the scene bi clicking left, right, down, etc.
