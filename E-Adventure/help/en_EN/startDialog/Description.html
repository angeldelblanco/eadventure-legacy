<p><b><center>Welcome to the &lt;e-Adventure&gt; editor! </center></b><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To get started using the editor you must choose between the options prompted here.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You can create a new file by clicking on the button you can find below. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You are allowed to create two different type of adventure games (this choice can be modified later):	
<UL type = disk > 
<LI>Adventures where the player is shown normally, as for instance, the MonkeyIslandTM saga (3rd person mode).<br><br>
<LI>Adventures where the player is not shown, giving the impression that the user is directly inside the game, as in the Myst saga (1st person mode).</p>
</UL>

&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not want to create a new adventure project, you can open an existing one by browsing the tabs above.
