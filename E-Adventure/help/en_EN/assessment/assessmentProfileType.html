<h1>Profile Type</h1>



<p>Due to the fact that it is allowed export in different standards of e-learning, 
there exist different profiles of evaluation and adjustment.
The choice of profile is related to the data model which is going to exchange 
information with the LMS, doing the pertinent restrictions on the same one. 
Actualemente podemos encontrar tres tipos.</p>


<OL>

<LI><p><b>Normal Profile</b> </p>
<p>There are not restrictions in LMS data model in this kind of profile and it is used for 
those standards that have no specific data model (like Learning Desing)</p>

<LI><p><b>Scrom v1.2 Profile</b></p>
<p>Limits the SCORM 1.2 data model. When it decides to modify or to consult properties of the LMS due to there has been fulfilled a assessment 
or adaptation rule, only it will allow us to choose between the parts of the SCORM 1.2 data model that are of writing or reading, according to the profile. 
Hereby one prevents from storing or consulting values in parts of the data model that are only of reading or only of writing, simultaneously that abstracts
 the exact knowledge of the above mentioned data model. If we want to export as Scorm 1.2, and we have profiles of assessment and / or adaptation assigned 
 to any of the chapters, it will be needed that the above mentioned profiles are of this type.</p>

<LI><p><b>Scorm 2004 Profile</b></p>
<p>It operates in an identical way that for the standard SCORM 1.2, but for the data model of the standard SCORM 2004.
If we want to export as Scorm 2004 or as AGREGA (the games exported to AGREGA uses SCORM 2004), and we have profiles 
of assessment and / or adaptation assigned to any of the chapters, it will be needed that the above mentioned profiles are of this type.
