associated with the rule will be executed. The above mentioned actions follows the same idea that the  
<A href="../adaptation/adaptationInitialState.html" label="initial state" title="initial state"> initial state</A>, 
it means, when the properties in LMS (defined in "LMS State" tab) were fulfilled there will be executed the initial scene that has associate the rule
(in this case it is showed at right of the rule description in the table of rules), and will be updated the 
variables and the flags that appear in the tab "Game State" in the low part of the screen 
(once we have selected a rule in question).
