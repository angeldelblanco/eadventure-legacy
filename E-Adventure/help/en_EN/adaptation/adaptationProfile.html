<h1>Adaptation Profile</h1>
<p>The way of generating the adaptation profiles is very similar to the generation of <a href="../assessment/assessmentProfile.html" label="assessment profiles" title="assessment profiles">assessment profiles</a>. Adaptation profiles are used to adapt (modifiy) the game based on a set of "external properties" regarding the users coming from the server (e.g. state of the LMS, Learning Managemente System).</p>
<p>When these properties are fulfilled at the beginning of the chapter a set of flags and initial variables are activated or deactivated automatically and the first scene changes (if desired). So, it is possible to change the number of available objects, adapt the difficulty according to the student profile, etc.</p>
<p>Also these external properties can be  empty in order to make changes in game automatically at startup. This way it is possible to provide differents version of the game simply by changing the adaptation profile associated with it.</p>
<p>In the same way that in assessment profiles, the type of adapatation profile must be set as SCORM 2004 or SCORM v1.2
if we are going to make an exportation of these types. If you select any type, a list will appear in the attribute "Id" of the 
state of the unit of learning with the parts of the SCORM data model which are available.</p>
