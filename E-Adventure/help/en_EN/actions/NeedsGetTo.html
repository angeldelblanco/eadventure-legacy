<h1>Needs to reach an object</h1>
<p>This function has no sense for first-person games. It can only be edited and <b>it is used in third-person games</b>.</p>
<h2>Activated</h2>
<p>When an action has this field activated that means that the character will have to walk to the object in order to perform an operation. If the character can not reach the object (for instance, because there is a barrier) the action will not be performed.</p>
<p>Besides, when the field is active the distance between the character and the object could be edited. The character will try to stay at that distance before performing the action.</p>
<h2>Deactivated</h2>
<p>If the field is not activated the character will stay with no movement, and it will perform the action form this place (if the other conditions are already true).</p>
