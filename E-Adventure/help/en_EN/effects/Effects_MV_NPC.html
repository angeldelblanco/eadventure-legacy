  <h1>Effect move character</h1>
<p>Through this effect we will be able to move the selected character to the selected position.</p>
<p>Create a move character effect:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Select the effect: </b>Select the effect on the creation effects panel. Press OK.</li>
  <li><b>Creation effect panel: </b>afterwards the next panel will appear:<img src="Effects_MV_NPC_files/MV_NPC_effect_ES.jpg" alt="MVNPC EFFECT.JPG fail!" style="display:block; margin:10px" /></li>
</ul>
    <p>In the first place we can move the aimed character. Afterwards we can select a scene from the chapter. As with other effects, the selection of the scene has the only purpose of preview, because the effect does not need to be related to the scene shown here. </p>
    <p>The movement of the person selected will be executed in the scene where this effect was defined. Once you have chosen the scene, you choose the position that the character will move, either filling in the X and Y coordinates or by clicking on the chosen position on the stage</p>
