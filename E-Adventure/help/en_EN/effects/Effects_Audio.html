<h1>Effect play sound</h1>
<p>This effect reproduces a sound</p>
<p>Create a play sound effect:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Select the effect: </b>Select the effect on the creation effects panel. Press OK.</li>
  <li><b>Creation effect panel: </b>afterwards the next panel will appear: <img src="Effects_Audio_files/Audio_effect_ES.jpg" alt="AUDIO EFFECT.JPG fail!" style="display:block; margin:10px" /></li></ul>
<p>  In the first place we find the posibitily to play the sound on the background. If this option is not activated, no action will take place (launch more effects, moving the player, etc) till the sound is not completely reproduced.  </p>
<p>Next to it   we find a field to select the audio file. After pressing it, in addition to the posibility of browsing the directories we can play the file we select, so there is no need of leaving the application to hear it.
  Once the file is selected, the reproduction button will be active. Through this button we can also pre-audite the sound file.  </p>
<p>If you want to delete the selection of the selected file, you can choose another, or press the red X below the path of the file.</p>
