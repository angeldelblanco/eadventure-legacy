<h1>Move Player effect</h1>
<p>Through this effect we can move the player to the selected position.</p>
<p>Create a move player effect:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Select the effect: </b>Select the effect on the creation effects panel. Press OK.</li>
	<li><b>Creation effect panel: </b>afterwards the next panel will appear:<img src="Effects_MV_Player_files/MV_Player_effect_ES.jpg" alt="MVPLAYER EFFECT.JPG fail!" style="display:block; margin:10px" /></li>
</ul>
<p>In the first place we are allowed to select one scene of the chapter. Like in other effects, the selection of the scene has the only aim of preview the scene, because the effect might not have any relationship with the scene. The movement of the player will execute in the scene which execute the effect. Once selected the scene, we choose the position where the player will move, either fulfilling X and Y coordinates or just by clicking in the position selected in the scene.</p>
